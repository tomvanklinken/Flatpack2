# Flatpack2

Arduino Library for communicating with Eltek Flatpack2 power supplies.

I found multiple pieces of code for communicating with Flatpack2 power supplies
but I wanted a library so my program code would be more clean.

### Features
- Automaticly login and assign ID to powersupplies on CAN bus
- Store last status in an object
- Call an callback on status request
- Send a broadcast to change voltage & current

### TODO
- Test with other revisions and multiple devices on bus
- Test current limit
- Add bootup voltage
- Cleanup receive code
